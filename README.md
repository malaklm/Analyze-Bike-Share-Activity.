# Analyze-Bike-Share-Activity.
As a one of Udacity data analyst Nanodegree program. This project use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major bike-share systems in the United States. The data will need to be munged into shape before being analyzed using descriptive statistics before being visualized.

## The purpose of this task is to become familiar with the data analysis process.

    This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
    The code should run w/o errors.
    Appropriate use of
        data structures/types
        loops/conditional statements
        Packages
        functions
        coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability)
    Analysis
        Pose two questions about the data
        Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
        Clean the data
        Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
        Visualize the data (instead of using plt use seaborn or ggplot)
        Perform additional exploratory analysis
        Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields
