# Analyze Bike Share Activity.
As a one of Udacity data analyst Nanodegree program. This project use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major bike-share systems in the United States. The data will need to be munged into shape before being analyzed using descriptive statistics before being visualized.

### The purpose of this task is to become familiar with the data analysis process.

* This process will be done using a Jupyter Notebook.
* The code should run without errors.
* Appropriate use of :
  * Data structures/types.
  * Loops/conditional statements.
  * Packages.
  * Functions.
  * Coding practices (i.e. Docstrings, comments, variable names & general readability)
   
### Analysis
* Pose two questions about the data
* Inspect the structure of the original data (very important)
* Clean the data
* Answer questions about the data using descriptive statistics
* Visualize the data (Using Matplotlib).
* Perform additional exploratory analysis.
* Consider where data analysis can be applied to other fields.

### File Descriptions
    ./data/ contains the various datasets
